# CS 4341 Project 2: Game Playing
## Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe
Project 2 for Sophia Strano, Luke Foley, &amp; Ilana Whittaker

## Initial Project Submission: Deadline: Tuesday, Oct. 4th at 9:00 pm

### To run and compile our program: 

Our "Urinetown" agent uses a javaScript file, "getMoves.js" to calculate its next move. To have our Agent play against itself, please call:
   - node testAgent.js Urinetown1
   
in one terminal, 
   - node testAgent.js Urinetown2
   
in another terminal (though other names should work),

and in the third and final terminal: 
   - python referee.py Urinetown1 Urinetown2
### Designing our Agent

- A detailed description of what each teammate contributed to the project.
   - Worked collaboratively while communicating with TA to develop initial psuedocode 
   The team worked both synchronously and asynchronously to complete the UTTT project in its entirety. Luke focused a lot of effort into developing minimax inside of the getMoves.js file. 

- The utility function that your program uses.
- The evaluation function that your program uses.
- The heuristics and/or strategies that you employed to decide how to expand nodes of the minimax tree without exceeding your time limit.
### Results
- describe which tests you ran to try out your program. Did your program play against human players? Did your program play against itself? Did your program play against other programs? How did your program do during those games?
-  Strengths and the weaknesses of your program.
- A discussion of why the evaluation function and the heuristic(s) you picked are good choices.

### Code.  
- The source code for your program
- Ancillary files, if any, that your program requires (e.g., such as a script to run a language interpreter).
