## Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe
Project 2 for Sophia Strano, Luke Foley, &amp; Ilana Whittaker

## Initial Project Submission: Deadline: Tuesday, Oct. 4th at 9:00 pm


- A detailed description of what each teammate contributed to the project.
   - Worked collaboratively while communicating with TA to develop initial psuedocode 
### To run and compile our program: 

- The utility function that your program uses.
- The evaluation function that your program uses.
- The heuristics and/or strategies that you employed to decide how to expand nodes of the minimax tree without exceeding your time limit.
### Results
- describe which tests you ran to try out your program. Did your program play against human players? Did your program play against itself? Did your program play against other programs? How did your program do during those games?
-  Strengths and the weaknesses of your program.
- A discussion of why the evaluation function and the heuristic(s) you picked are good choices.

### Code.  
- The source code for your program
- Ancillary files, if any, that your program requires (e.g., such as a script to run a language interpreter).
Please note: Although you are welcome to look at code and systems available online to guide the design of your program, you MUST submit your own original code.
